# README: Python API Coding Exercise

## Problem

We're starting a new application and we need to store students! We'd like to be
able to do the following with the students:

- Create a student
- Retrieve a particular student by unique identifier
- Search students in the system

**1.** Format

The application should accept and produce JSON with appropriate content types.

**2.** Data

The student record has the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| ---- | ------ |
| `id` | An `id` that uniquely identifies the student. This will be provided by the server when the student is created and must not be changed after creation. |
| `email` | Either an `email` or a `username` must be non-blank, and whichever (or both) are defined the value must be unique within that field. Additionally, the `email` field should contain a superficially valid email.|
|`first_name` & `last_name`| A `first_name` and `last_name`; the `last_name` is required to be non-blank.|
|`display_name`| A `display_name`, which if not defined at creation should be the first name and last names joined with a space.|
|`created_at`|The `created_at` datetime when the student was added to the system, which should be assigned by the system when the student is created. It should be formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' -- for example '2016-11-08 22:18:03' for 'November 8, 2016 at 10:18:03 PM'.|
|`started_at`|The `started_at` date of the student started at an institution; if not specified it should be the date the student was added to the system. It should be formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD' -- for example, '2016-11-08' for 'November 8, 2016'.|

**3.** Search

The students may be searched by the following fields:

|field|Description|
|----|------|
|`name`| (which is a partial match against any of the first name, last name, and display name)|
|`username`| (partial match)|
|`email`| (partial match)|
|`started_after`| (date formatted `YYYY-MM-DD` that will return students who started on or after a particular date)|

If multiple fields provided any returned records must match all of them 
-- that is, you should treat them as an `AND`. For example, the following query would find students with 'Jen' in their name who started after 'November 15, 2016':

```
GET /students?name=Jen&started_after=2016-11-15
```

**4.** Routes

The routes you should use are:

- Create a student: `POST /students`
- Search students: `GET /students`
- Retrieve a student: `GET /students/{id}` (where `{id}` is the value assigned
  by the server)
- Health check: `GET /service/health` should return a successful HTTP status

**5.** Other thoughts

For example:

- How might student data be changed?
- What if we wanted to create many students at once?
- What if we wanted to assign each student to a school? More than one school?
- What if we wanted to track whether the student has logged in?

## Languages and Environment

**1.** Languages

Please use **Python** as programming languages to solve this problem:

**2.** Runtime

Your solution must be runnable via Docker. There's a starter
`docker-compose.yaml` file in this directory you can use to run your solution
with a Postgres database and Redis key/value store. When we run your
application we'll check out your git repository and run `docker-compose up` and
expect it to run.

Note that your solution does not have to use either Postgres or Redis to store its
state -- we'll restart your service every time we check its output. But if
you'd like to use a persistent store for state you should use one of those two.

If you use external libraries you should use standard dependency management
tools to declare them -- for example, `requirements.txt` for Python projects,
`Gemfile` for Ruby projects, etc. The steps to install those dependencies
should be in your `Dockerfile` so that when we run `docker-compose build` the
container for your service will be built and ready to go.

**3.** Testing

Unit tests are encouraged but not required; if you're trying to implement this
solution in a different language we'll understand if you spend your time on the
solution rather than the tests. (Especially because we provide a test harness,
see below.)

## Checking your work

There is a `exercise/` directory in this repo with a script that you can use to
exercise your solution with Docker. All you'll need to do is build it:

```
$ cd exercise
$ docker build -t coding-check .
```

And then point it at your solution, passing in the top-level URL to a running
server:

```
$ docker run --rm coding-check http://myhost:8888
```

If everything is working you should expect to see output like this:

```
test_can_fetch_created (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_can_provide_display_name (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_fail_duplicate_email (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_fail_missing_email_or_username (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_fail_missing_last_name (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_fills_in_date_fields (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_generates_display_name (__main__.VerifyCreate) ... ok
test_fetch_invalid_id (__main__.VerifyFetch) ... ok
test_empty_results_with_records_and_no_match (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok
test_multiple_match_any_name (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok
test_multiple_matches_started_after (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok
test_no_criteria_is_invalid (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok
test_no_match_started_after (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok
test_single_match_first_name (__main__.VerifySearch) ... ok

# Helpful Resources

Here are some resources that may be useful:

- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or
  [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) should
  help you get Docker installed if you don't already have it. (If you're using
  a Linux desktop you can just `sudo apt-get install docker` -- lucky you!)
  Another resource is [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) which
  walks you through installing Docker on a VM running on VirtualBox; you may
  prefer that if you've already got VirtualBox installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) -- This should already be
  installed if you use the Docker for Mac/Windows options, but if not it's just
  a binary you can install. Note that the
  [sample project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) uses Flask!
  (We use Flask.)
